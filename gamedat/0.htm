15 7 Reform of patent Laws in France -
Since the law of patents went into operation in France- that is to say, since January 1791- there have been issued 68,000 patents. The number of inventors has regularly increased not withstanding the little success of most of their inventions.
In fifty-four years (from 1791 to 1844) but 7,290 patents were issued-about 320 a year.
From 1844 to the first of January, 1858, fourteen years, 46,129 were issed-an average of 3,195 a year.
it is now in contemplation to revise the law of patents in France, and the general polict of the system is under discussion. Some very radical changes are suggested, even in semi-official journals. They say that it is a fact demonstrated by experience, that inventors are more often ruined than enriched by their discoveries. M Theodore Reginauld, a member of the commision who remodelled the law in 1828, and who is now occupies in the revision of existing legislation, declares that he knows of very few inventors who have ever made a fortune; that if five per cent have been indemnified for their expenses and sacrifices of one nature and another, it is a large proportion; while those who have succeeded are extremely rare.
The reason, as he suggests, is very simple. Every patent has to contend against counterfeiting as long as it lasts-to defend its privilege, and to waste its time and resources in ever renewing legal contests. Triumphs cost as much as defeats, and it is not a rare thing to see a man ruined in gainning fifteen or twenty suits.
One commercial house in Paris is cited which had out of one hundred and sixty-seven suits, obtainted one hundred and twenty-two judgments in the Court of "First Instance", thirty-four decrees of the Imperial Court, and ten decrees of the Court of Cassation.
One decision on a patent does not prevent another and another, and thus a man may be kept in constant litigation to defend his property.
The new project, which is evidently recieving most favour from the government, is one which is addressed particularly to this class of embarrassments.
It provides that the inventor shall have two years in which to try his patent and to claim for it official confirmation. His claim is announced in the official journal, and during th two years it can be tested by those who feel disposed. If at the end of two years the opposition is not sustained, the Minister of Commerce issues a confirmation of the patent. This patent confirmed, can never again be attached by third parties. This no doubt would be a great protection, but with us the great mass of litigation about patents arises from a dispute as to what is and what is not an infringement of them. - N.Y. Eve Post

15 7 Hiring Slaves In Virginia -
The streets have begun to show signs of hiring days by the numerous groups of servants crowding the streets in search of homes for the ensuing year, and owing to the political troubles now affecting the country, negroes  of all classes have fallen considerably. Factory hands that hired for $150 to $200 a year, it is thought will hire at or about $100 to $125 for the next, and only a very few have of yet to be hired. Cooks without incumbrance, and house servants, as far as we are able to learn, will hire for nearly the same as they did this year. - Petersburgh Inteligencer

15 7 How much Pork will a Bushel of Corn Make? -
The following valuable facts are from the Valley Farmer, upon the question of "How much pork will a bushel of corn make?" Mr. Richard Thatcher, of Pennsylvania, gives, in the New York Tribune, the result of his feeding scalded or cooked corn meal, in several instances, in fattening hogs. The result of one trial gave sixteen  and one half punds to fifty-six pounds of meal fed out. In another instance, seventeen and nearly one half pounds were the gain from the bushel. The breeed of hogs experimented upon wer the "Chester" (county, PA) which we regard as amoung the best breeds now in the country. We have recently seen accounts of several other experiments of feeding hogs in the same way with similar results, while the same breed of hogs fed in the ordinary way, upon dry corn in the ear, gave a return of but about one-third of the weight, compared with those fed on teh cooked meal.
The experiments of Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, as detailed in the December number or the Valley Farmer for 1856, afford conclusive evidence of the advantage of feeding cooked over raw food. In the experiments on the same animals it was proved that dry  corn would afford a gain of about 5 and 3 quaters to 6 and 3 quarters of pork to each bushel consumed, but when changed to food prepared by grinding and cooking, gave a return of from fifteen to nearly eighteen pounds of flesh for each bushel corn fed out. These various experiments demonstrate facts worthy of the consideration of farmers, and especially when the price of corn and pork is constantly advancing.
When care in breeding from good stock of hogs, and their proper management throughout, keeping the hogs constantly thriving, at least an average of fifteen pounds of flesh may be recived from every bushel of corn consumed. A few well conducted experiments in feeding, with appropriate apparatus for preparing the food, compared with facts determining the amunt of grain from the ordinary method of feeding, would forever settle the question, and lead to valuable improvements in this most important interest to western farmers.

15 7 Skating - The Buffalo Republic says: "There are two classses of skaters - those who skate merely because it is a fashion and those who skate because they enjoy it. To the first, a word: If you will skate you must tumble down, but don't swear. Do not attemt any fancy skating. Don't cut pigeon wings or sixes and sevens. Make your skating a straight forward piece of business. Skate calmly, moderately and deliberately. Pad the back of your head as thickly as possible, or you may be obliged to sudy astronomy under difficulties, and discover bumps which Fowler never dreamed of."

15 7 Dyeing and Painting a White Girl to Make Her Pass for a Slave - The Natchez Free Press gives the following narrative, with full confidence in its truth:
"One day last week, a gentleman from this city hailed an up country boat, the Cora Anderson, as she was passing Greenville, Mississippi, whither he had gone on business, to return home. Shortly after being under wat, our Natchez friend observed a pensive-looking little girl, aged about nine or ten years, whose black hair and yellowish-brown skin would indicate that she was a mulattress. There was something about her that interested him and he enquired of the captain concerning her. He was informed that she was a slave belonging to a man on board, whom the captain pointed out, who said he was taking her to New Orleans to sell her, he having bought her for $160 in North Western Misouri, on the borders. Our Natchez friend eyed the little girl and the border man so closely as to attract the attention of the latter, with whom he was soon engaged in conversation concerning the child, interrogating him in such a manner as to elicit answers not always agreeing with previous statements, and evidently alarming him. This was suspicious.
The little girl was taken aside and examined. She said she was an orphan, and had beem taken from an asylum in New York by this man; that her hair was light and her complexion brunette; that this man told her he was going to the South with her, where as his adopted child s, she would have a good homel that black hair was preffered in the South, and prettier than hers, and he had taken her to a barber and had her hair dyed black. He also told her that if she would allow him to put some yellow dye on her skin that her complexion would be much whiter in a few days, and that he had put the stain on. On hearing these statements the girl was taken charge of by the captain, and potsash, soap and water being applied, the dyes were taken off and the light hair and complexion brought to light. The pretended master was seized by the excited passengers, who were about to deal with him summarily, but it was finally arranged to lock him up in the stateroom until the boat should land. In the meantime the boat had passed St. Joseph, and when a few miles below that town rounded to take on wood. At this point, how, or in what manner is not known, the border ruffian escaped frm the boat, leaving his baggage behind. The girl was taken by the captain of the boat to New Orleans, and placed in one of the asylums in that city."
