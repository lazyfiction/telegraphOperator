## Intro

A simple broser game in which the player assumes the role of a telegraph operator 
in Columbus, Ohio (The wild west of the telegraphy lines :P), in 1861. 

This game is a work of historical fiction
certain inaccuracies have been chosen for gameplay reasons
* ITU morse code is used and not the American morse of the time 
* Operator gossip and telegram messages are completely fabricated
* The splash screen is actually an image of Winnipeg, Canada.

 the player has three functions as a telegraph operator
 
  1. correctly interpret the incoming '92 code' and adjust the party line switchboard accordingly
  2. transmit a text message down the line in morse code (score is percentage match between transmitted message and given text)
  3. interperete incomin morse code (score as above)
